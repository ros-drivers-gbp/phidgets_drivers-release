ros-noetic-phidgets-temperature (1.0.0-1buster) buster; urgency=high

  * Update maintainers in package.xml
  * Switch to libphidget22
  * Add launch files for all drivers.
  * Add in try/catch blocks for connecting.
    If an error occurs, we catch it, print it, then re-throw it.
    This allows us to show a better error when using nodelets.
  * Documentation updates to README.md
  * Set the publish_rate to 0 by default.
    This means we will only publish on changes.
  * Add in the license files and add to the headers.
  * Remove nodes in favor of nodelets.
  * Add in support for Phidgets Temperature sensors.
  * Contributors: Chris Lalancette, Martin Günther
